# FormFarm

FormFarm is a web application that digitizes the IIPP reporting process. It benefits farm workers by ensuring that safety regulations are followed via the crew leader, providing a safe work environment. The crew leader will log onto the application and they would fill their IIP checklist for the tasks needed to be done that day. Improved efficiency and detailed documentation is the goal. It benefits OSHA because it provides a clear, timestamped record of when these forms are filled out, and the new farmers would have easier access to these forms instead of having to search for them on the OSHA website.
